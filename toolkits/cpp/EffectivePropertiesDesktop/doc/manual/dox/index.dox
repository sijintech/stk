@section intro Introduction
Mu-PROÂ® Effective Properties Desktop version is a simulation program for calculating the various effective properties and field distribution within an arbitrary inhomogeneous microstructure under an applied external stimuli. 

This program calculates the effective properties of a multi-phase/domain composite by solving equilibrium equations using the Fourier spectral iterative perturbation method.

Due to its outstanding efficiency, the program can be used to generate large microstructure-property databases for machine learning.

From the input and output point of view, Effective Properties Desktop has the following features.

@subsection input Input 
1. digitized microstructure from a computer simulation or experiment, we can read ASCII export from [Dream3D](http://dream3d.bluequartz.net/).
2. properties for each of the phases/crystals/domains that constitute the microstructure

@subsection output Output 
1. effective scaler or tensorial properties
2. spatial distributions of property fields such as electric potential/field, mechanical displacement/strain/stress fields, magnetic field, concentration, temperature.

@subsection extension The code also provides
1. graphical input for entering input parameters
2. a microstructure generator for some representative two-phase microstructures
3. graphical visualization of output field distributions
